<!-- Plugin info START -->

**Openini** is a plugin for IntelliJ-based IDEs that allows opening individual files, folders, and projects inside the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) applications without ever leaving the IntelliJ IDE.

## Why

There are cases when it is easier to perform specific tasks in another application rather than in the IntelliJ IDE. It is up to you to find those cases.

## How

Right-click in the editor or project window and select **Openini**:

- **Open File in Sublime Text** to open the selected files or folders inside the Sublime Text application. _(NOTE: name changes based on selection)_
- **Open Project in Sublime Text** to open the project associated with the selected files or folders inside the Sublime Text application.
- **Get Sublime Text** to open official Sublime Text webpage <https://www.sublimetext.com/>.
- **Open File in VSCode** to open the selected files or folders inside the VSCode application. _(NOTE: name changes based on selection)_
- **Open Project in VSCode** to open the project associated with the selected files or folders inside the VSCode application.
- **Get VSCode** to open official VSCode webpage <https://code.visualstudio.com/>.

## Prerequisites

Obviously, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and/or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) must be installed on your system in order to use **Openini**. Additionally, if you're on a Mac, please [add VSCode to your $PATH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

## Installation

1. Download the latest plugin version from the [releases](https://github.com/rendertom/openini/releases) section.
2. In the IntelliJ IDE:
   1. Navigate to the Settings > Plugins window.
   2. Click on the gear icon and select "Install Plugin from Disk..."
   3. Select the file you downloaded in step #1.
